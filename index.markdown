**BrickMMO CDN is the recommended CDN for all shared BrickMMO images, icons, CSS, and JavaScript files.**

Include CSS files by placing a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.brickmmo.com/library@1.0.0/librry.css">
```

Include JavaScript files by placing a `<script>` tag directly before your closing `</body>` tag in your HTML document:

```
<script src="https://cdn.brickmmo.com/library@1.0.0/librry.js"></script>
```
